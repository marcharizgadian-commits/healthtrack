  <h2>Meaning of the Wellness Score</h2>

  <p>
    The <strong>Wellness Score</strong> is a numerical value (0–100) that shows how healthy
    a user’s daily habits are. It is calculated based on four factors:
    <strong>sleep, exercise, water intake, and mood</strong>.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>80–100 (Excellent ✅)</strong> – The user has healthy habits and is taking good care of their well-being.</li>
    <li><strong>60–79 (Good 🙂)</strong> – The user has generally healthy habits but still has areas to improve.</li>
    <li><strong>40–59 (Needs Improvement ⚠️)</strong> – The user needs to improve habits such as exercise, hydration, or sleep.</li>
    <li><strong>Below 40 (Poor ❌)</strong> – The user has unhealthy habits that may affect their health negatively.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This score helps users reflect on their lifestyle and encourages healthier
    daily choices in support of <strong>SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being</strong>.

  The wellness score shows how healthy a user’s daily habits are based on sleep,
  exercise, water intake, and mood. Higher scores mean healthier habits, while
  lower scores indicate areas that need improvement.
